## Typing Basics
Typing is essential. We’ll start slow and accurate, speed comes later.

- Fingers on the home row:

   `Left: A S D F`

  `Right: J K L ;`

  `Thumbs on the space bar.`

- Try this simple exercise:

<code>
Type this slowly, focus on accuracy:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</code>


- Repeat it **10 time**, and count errors.

Goal: **accuracy > 95%**, don’t worry about speed yet.
